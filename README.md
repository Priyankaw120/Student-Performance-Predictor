# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor

**Overview**  
A classification model predicting whether a student will pass or fail based on exam scores and demographic data.  
Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. 

If we only had the final exam marks, we could manually label Pass or Fail.
But the purpose of this project isnâ€™t to re-check marks; itâ€™s to predict outcomes before exams happen, using other factors like study time, parental education, and test preparation.
In a real educational setting, this helps identify at-risk students early and provide support before they fail.

**Key Steps**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature encoding and model building  
- Decision Tree and Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy evaluation and visualization  

**Result**  
Achieved ~85% accuracy on the test set.
